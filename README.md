ðŸŒ† Air Quality Analysis Dashboard | NYC NOâ‚‚ Pollution Trends ðŸ“Š
Excited to share my latest project: an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Nitrogen Dioxide (NOâ‚‚) levels across New York City! ðŸ§ªðŸŒ¿
Using open-source data from data.gov, this dashboard explores:
âœ… Trends in NOâ‚‚ over time
 âœ… Seasonal variation in pollution levels
 âœ… Comparison of average vs. maximum NOâ‚‚ values
 âœ… Spatial differences across NYC boroughs
 âœ… Identification of high-risk locations
This project not only highlights how Microsoft Excel can be used for powerful data visualization and storytelling, but also emphasizes the importance of environmental data in shaping cleaner, healthier cities.
